<blockquote>
<p>This process is modelled after the approach taken by the Rust programming language, see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs">Rust RFC repository</a> for more
information. Also see <a href="https://github.com/maidsafe/rfcs">maidsafe's RFC process</a> for another project into the crypto space. Our approach is taken and
adapted from these.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make more substantial changes to Bee, we ask for these to go through a more organized design process --- a <em>RFC</em>
(request for comments) process. The goal is to organize work between the different developers affiliated with the IOTA
Foundation, and the wider open source community. We want to vet the ideas early on, get and give feedback, and only then
start the implementation once the biggest questions are taken care of.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-substantial-and-when-to-follow-this-process" id="what-is-substantial-and-when-to-follow-this-process">What is <em>substantial</em> and when to follow this process</a></h2>
<p>You need to follow this process if you intend to make <em>substantial</em> changes to Bee and any of its constituting
subcrates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything that constitutes a breaking change as understood in the context of <em>semantic versioning</em>.</li>
<li>Any semantic or syntactic change to the existing algorithms that is not a bug fix.</li>
<li>Any proposed additional functionality and feature.</li>
<li>Anything that reduces interoperability (e.g. changes to public interfaces, the wire protocol or data serialisation.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some changes do not require an RFC:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rephrasing, reorganizing, refactoring, or otherwise &quot;changing shape does not change meaning&quot;.</li>
<li>Additions that strictly improve objective, numerical quality criteria (warning removal, speedup, better platform
coverage, more parallelism, trap more errors, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Internal</em> additions, i.e. additions that are invisible to users of the public API, and which probably will be only
noticed by developers of Bee.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit a pull request to implement a new feature without going through the RFC process, it may be closed with a
polite request to submit an RFC first.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-workflow-of-the-rfc-process" id="the-workflow-of-the-rfc-process">The workflow of the RFC process</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>With both Rust and maidsafe being significantly larger projects, not all the steps below might be relevant to Bee's
RFC process (for example, at the moment there are no dedicated subteams). However, to instill good open source
governance we attempt to follow this process already now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, to get a major feature added to Bee, one must first get the RFC merged into the RFC repository as a markdown
file. At that point the RFC is &quot;active&quot; and may be implemented with the goal of eventual inclusion into Bee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the RFC repository</li>
<li>Copy <code>0000-template.md</code> to <code>text/0000-my-feature.md</code> (where &quot;my-feature&quot; is descriptive; don't assign
an RFC number yet; extra documents such as graphics or diagrams go into the new folder).</li>
<li>Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: RFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate lack of
understanding of the design's impact, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be
poorly-received.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design feedback from the larger community, and the
author should be prepared to revise it in response.</li>
<li>Each pull request will be labeled with the most relevant sub-team, which will lead to its being triaged by that team
in a future meeting and assigned to a member of the subteam.</li>
<li>Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much more likely to make progress than those
that don't receive any comments. Feel free to reach out to the RFC assignee in particular to get help identifying
stakeholders and obstacles.</li>
<li>The sub-team will discuss the RFC pull request, as much as possible in the comment thread of the pull request itself.
Offline discussion will be summarized on the pull request comment thread.</li>
<li>RFCs rarely go through this process unchanged, especially as alternatives and drawbacks are shown. You can make edits,
big and small, to the RFC to clarify or change the design, but make changes as new commits to the pull request, and
leave a comment on the pull request explaining your changes. Specifically, do not squash or rebase commits after they
are visible on the pull request.</li>
<li>At some point, a member of the subteam will propose a &quot;motion for final comment period&quot; (FCP), along with a
disposition for the RFC (merge, close, or postpone).
<ul>
<li>This step is taken when enough of the tradeoffs have been discussed that the subteam is in a position to make a
decision. That does not require consensus amongst all participants in the RFC thread (which is usually
impossible). However, the argument supporting the disposition on the RFC needs to have already been clearly
articulated, and there should not be a strong consensus against that position outside of the subteam.
Subteam members use their best judgment in taking this step, and the FCP itself ensures there is ample time and
notification for stakeholders to push back if it is made prematurely.</li>
<li>For RFCs with lengthy discussion, the motion to FCP is usually preceded by a summary comment trying to lay out the
current state of the discussion and major tradeoffs/points of disagreement.</li>
<li>Before actually entering FCP, all members of the subteam must sign off; this is often the point at which many
subteam members first review the RFC in full depth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The FCP lasts ten calendar days, so that it is open for at least 5 business days. It is also advertised widely, e.g.
on discord or in a blog post. This way all stakeholders have a chance to lodge any final objections before a decision
is reached.</li>
<li>In most cases, the FCP period is quiet, and the RFC is either merged or closed. However, sometimes substantial new
arguments or ideas are raised, the FCP is canceled, and the RFC goes back into development mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-rfc-life-cycle" id="the-rfc-life-cycle">The RFC life-cycle</a></h2>
<p>Once an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the feature as a pull request to the repo. Being
&quot;active&quot; is not a rubber stamp and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately be merged. It does mean
that in principle all the major stakeholders have agreed to the feature and are amenable to merging it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted and is &quot;active&quot; implies nothing about what priority is assigned
to its implementation, nor does it imply anything about whether a developer has been assigned the task of implementing
the feature. While it is not necessary that the author of the RFC also write the implementation, it is by far the most
effective way to see an RFC through to completion. Authors should not expect that other project developers will take on
responsibility for implementing their accepted feature.</p>
<p>Modifications to active RFCs can be done in follow up PRs. We strive to write each RFC in a manner that it will reflect
the final design of the feature, however, the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged RFC to
actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next major release. We therefore try to keep each RFC
document somewhat in sync with the network feature as planned, tracking such changes via followup pull requests to the
document.</p>
<p>An RFC that makes it through the entire process to implementation is considered &quot;implemented&quot; and is moved to the
&quot;implemented&quot; folder. An RFC that fails after becoming active is &quot;rejected&quot; and moves to the &quot;rejected&quot; folder.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#reviewing-rfcs" id="reviewing-rfcs">Reviewing RFCs</a></h2>
<p>While the RFC pull request is up, the sub-team may schedule meetings with the author and/or relevant stakeholders to
discuss the issues in greater detail, and in some cases the topic may be discussed at a sub-team meeting. In either case
a summary from the meeting will be posted back to the RFC pull request.</p>
<p>A sub-team makes final decisions about RFCs after the benefits and drawbacks are well understood. These decisions can be
made at any time, but the sub-team will regularly issue decisions. When a decision is made, the RFC pull request will
either be merged or closed. In either case, if the reasoning is not clear from the discussion in thread, the sub-team
will add a comment describing the rationale for the decision.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementing-an-rfc" id="implementing-an-rfc">Implementing an RFC</a></h2>
<p>Some accepted RFCs represent vital features that need to be implemented right away. Other accepted RFCs can represent
features that can wait until some arbitrary developer feels like doing the work. Every accepted RFC has an associated
issue tracking its implementation in the affected repositories. Therefore, the associated issue can be assigned a
priority via the triage process that the team uses for all issues in the appropriate repositories.</p>
<p>The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome
to post an implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.</p>
<p>If you are interested in working on the implementation for an &quot;active&quot; RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is
already working on it, feel free to ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rfc-postponement" id="rfc-postponement">RFC postponement</a></h2>
<p>Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the &quot;postponed&quot; label when they are closed (as part of the rejection process).
An RFC closed with &quot;postponed&quot; is marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal nor
about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, and we believe that we can afford to wait until
then to do so. Historically, &quot;postponed&quot; was used to postpone features until after 1.0. Postponed pull requests may be
re-opened when the time is right. We don't have any formal process for that, you should ask members of the relevant
sub-team.</p>
<p>Usually an RFC pull request marked as &quot;postponed&quot; has already passed an informal first round of evaluation, namely the
round of &quot;do we think we would ever possibly consider making this change, as outlined in the RFC pull request, or some
semi-obvious variation of it.&quot; (When the answer to the latter question is &quot;no&quot;, then the appropriate response is to
close the RFC, not postpone it.)</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#help-this-is-all-too-informal" id="help-this-is-all-too-informal">Help! This is all too informal</a></h2>
<p>The process is intended to be as lightweight as reasonable for the present circumstances. As usual, we are trying to let
the process be driven by consensus and community norms, not impose more structure than necessary.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h1>
<p>This RFC introduces the IOTA protocol messages that were initially added in
<a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/pull/1393">IRI#1393</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>To be able to take part in the IOTA networks, Bee nodes need to implement the exact same protocol presented in this RFC
and currently being used by <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/iri">IRI</a> nodes and
<a href="https://github.com/gohornet/hornet">HORNET</a> nodes. However, it does not necessarily mean implementing the same versions
of the protocol. A design decision - later explained - concludes that Bee nodes and IRI nodes will not be able to
communicate with each other.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design" id="detailed-design">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p>This section details:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Message</code> trait that provides serialization and deserialization of messages to and from byte buffers;</li>
<li>A type-length-value protocol - on top of the trait - that adds metadata in order to send and receive the messages over
a transport layer;</li>
<li>The current <code>Message</code> implementations representing handshake, requests, responses, events, ...;</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#message-trait" id="message-trait"><code>Message</code> trait</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Message</code> trait is protocol agnostic and only provides serialization and deserialization to and from byte buffers.
It should not be used as is but rather be paired with a higher layer - like a type-length-value encoding - and as such
does not provide any bounds check on inputs/outputs buffers.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>size_range</code> returns an allowed range for the message size because some parts of some messages can be trimmed. It is

<li><code>into_bytes</code> does not allocate a buffer because the following TLV protocol implies concatenating a header inducing
another allocation. Since this is a hot path, a slice of an already allocated buffer for both the header and payload
is expected; hence, limiting the amount of allocation to the bare minimum;</li>

<p>A transaction encoded in bytes - using the T5B1 codec - has a length of <code>1604</code>. The <code>payload</code> field itself occupies

<h1><a class="header" href="#drawbacks" id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></h1>
<p>Since IRI nodes only implement version <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> and Bee nodes only implement versions <code>0</code> and <code>2</code>, they will not be
able to communicate with each other.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives" id="rationale-and-alternatives">Rationale and alternatives</a></h1>
<p>There are alternatives to a type-length-value protocol but it is very efficient and easily updatable without breaking
change. Also, since this is the protocol that has been chosen for the IOTA network, there is no other alternative for
Bee.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions" id="unresolved-questions">Unresolved questions</a></h1>

<p>This RFC and its expected implementations are choosing <code>TOML</code> as a first default configuration format because it is the
preferred option in the Rust ecosystem. However, it is not excluded by this RFC that other formats may be provided in
the future, <code>serde</code> making it very easy to support other formats. It is also important to note that TOML only provides
a limited amount of layers of nesting due to its non-recursive syntax, which may eventually become an issue.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#summary-2" id="summary-2">Summary</a></h1>
<p>This RFC proposes a networking crate (<code>bee-network</code>) to be added to the <strong>Bee</strong> framework that provides means to exchange byte messages with connected endpoints.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation-2" id="motivation-2">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>Bee nodes need a way to share messages with each other and other compatible node implementations as part of the IOTA gossip protocol or they won't be able to form a network and synchronize with each other.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-2" id="detailed-design-2">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p>The functionalities of this crate are relatively low-level from a node perspective in the sense, that they are independent from any specifics defined by the IOTA protocol. Consequently, it has no dependencies on other crates of the framework, and can easily be reused in different contexts.</p>
<p>The aim of this crate is to make it simple and straightforward for developers to build layers on top of it (e.g. a protocol layer) by abstracting away all the underlying networking logic. It is therefore a lot easier for them to focus on the modelling of other important aspects of a node software, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Peer</code>s: other nodes in the network,</li>
<li><code>Message</code>es: the information exchanged between peers, and its serialization/deserialization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given some identifier <code>epid</code>, sending a message to its corresponding endpoint becomes a single line of asynchronous code:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>network.send(SendMessage { epid, bytes: &quot;hello&quot;.as_bytes() }).await?;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The purpose of this crate is to provide the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintain a list of endpoints,</li>
<li>establish and maintain connections with endpoints,</li>
<li>allow to send, multicast or broadcast byte encoded messages of variable size to any of the endpoints,</li>
<li>allow to receive byte encoded messages of variable size from any of the endpoints,</li>
<li>reject connections from unknown, i.e. not whitelisted, endpoints,</li>
<li>manage all connections and message transfers asynchronously,</li>
<li>provide an extensible, yet convenient-to-use, and documented API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key design decisions are now being discussed in the following sub-sections.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#asyncawait" id="asyncawait">async/await</a></h2>
<p>This crate is by nature very much dependent on events happening outside of the control of the program, e.g. listening for incoming connections from peers, waiting for packets on a specific socket, etc. Hence, - under the hood - this crate makes heavy use of Rust's concurrency abstractions. Luckily, with the stabilization of the <code>async/await</code> syntax, writing asynchronous code has become almost as easy to read, write, and maintain as synchronous code. In an experimental implementation of this crate the <a href="https://github.com/async-rs/async-std"><code>async_std</code></a> library was used, which comes with asynchronous drop-in replacements for their synchronous equivalents found in Rust's standard library <code>std</code>. Additionally, asynchronous mpsc channels were taken from the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/futures-rs"><code>futures</code></a> crate.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#message-passing" id="message-passing">Message passing</a></h2>
<p>This crate favors message passing via channels over globally shared state and locks. Instead of keeping the list of endpoints in a globally accessible hashmap this crate separates and moves such state into workers that run asynchronously, and are listening for commands and events to act upon, and also notify listeners by sending events.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#initialization" id="initialization">Initialization</a></h2>
<p>In order for this crate to be used, it has to be initialized first by providing a <code>NetworkConfig</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct NetworkConfig {
    // The server or binding TCP port that remote endpoints can connect and send to.
    binding_port: u16,
    // The binding address that remote endpoints can connect and send to.
    binding_addr: IpAddr,
    // The interval between two connection attempts in case of connection failures.
    reconnect_interval: u64,
    // The maximum message length in terms of bytes.
    max_message_length: usize

    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This has the advantage of being easily extensible and keeping the signature of the static <code>init</code> function small:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn init(config: NetworkConfig) -&gt; (Network, Events, Shutdown) { ... }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This function returns a tuple struct that allows the consumer of this crate to send commands (<code>Network</code>), listen to events (<code>Events</code>), and gracefully shutdown all running asynchronous tasks that were spawned within this system (<code>Shutdown</code>).</p>
<p>See also  <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/blob/master/text/0031-configuration.md">RFC 31</a>, which describes a configuration pattern for Bee binary and library crates.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#port-address-protocol-and-url" id="port-address-protocol-and-url"><code>Port</code>, <code>Address</code>, <code>Protocol</code>, and <code>Url</code></a></h2>
<p>In order to send a message to an endpoint, a node needs to know the endpoint's address and the communication protocol it uses. This crate provides the following abstractions to deal with that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Port</code>: a 0-cost wrapper around a <code>u16</code>, which is introduced for type safety and better readability:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Port(u16);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>For convenience, <code>Port</code> dereferences to <code>u16</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Address</code>: a 0-cost wrapper around a <code>SocketAddr</code> which provides an adjusted, but overall simpler API than its inner type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Eq, Hash, PartialEq)]
struct Address(SocketAddr);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>An <code>Address</code> can be constructed from Ipv4 and Ipv6 addresses and a port:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Infallible construction of an `Address` from Ipv4.
fn from_v4_addr_and_port(address: Ipv4Addr, port: Port) -&gt; Self { ... }

// Infallible construction of an `Address` from Ipv6.
fn from_v6_addr_and_port(address: Ipv6Addr, port: Port) -&gt; Self { ... }

// Fallible construction of an `Address` from `&amp;str`.
async fn from_addr_str(address: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt; { ... }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note, that the last function is <code>async</code>. That is because of possible delays when performing domain name resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Protocol</code>: an <code>enum</code>eration of supported communication protocols:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[non_exhaustive]
enum Protocol {
    Tcp,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note, that future updates may support different protocols, which is why this enum is declared as <code>non_exhaustive</code>, see <code>Unresolved Questions</code> section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Url</code>: an <code>enum</code>eration that can always be constructed from an <code>Address</code> and a <code>Protocol</code> (infallible), or from a <code>&amp;str</code>, which can fail if parsing or domain name resolution fails. If successfull however, it resolves to an Ipv4 or Ipv6 address stored in a variant of the <code>enum</code> depending on the url scheme part. Note, that this crate therefore expects the <code>Url</code> string to always provide a scheme (e.g. <code>tcp://</code>) and a port (e.g. <code>15600</code>) when specifying an endpoint's address.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[non_exhaustive]
enum Url {
    // Represents the address of an endpoint communicating over TCP.
    Tcp(Address),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note, that future updates may support different protocols, which is why this enum is declared as <code>non_exhaustive</code>, see <code>Unresolved Questions</code> section.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// Infallible construction of a `Url` from an `Address` and a `Protocol`.
fn new(addr: Address, proto: Protocol) -&gt; Self { ... }

// Fallible construction of a `Url` from `&amp;str`.
async fn from_url_str(url: &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt; { ... }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note, that the second function is <code>async</code>. That is because of possible delays when performing domain name resolution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#endpoint-and-endpointid" id="endpoint-and-endpointid"><code>Endpoint</code> and <code>EndpointId</code></a></h2>
<p>To model the remote part of a connection, this crate introduces the <code>Endpoint</code> type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Endpoint {
    // The id of the endpoint.
    id: EndpointId,

    // The address of the endpoint.
    address: Address,

    // The protocol used to communicate with that endpoint.
    protocol: Protocol,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note: In a peer-to-peer (p2p) network peers usually have two endpoints initially as they are actively trying to connect, but also need to accept connections from their peers. This crate is agnostic about how to handle duplicate connections as this is usually resolved by a handshaking protocol defined at a higher layer.</p>
<p>To uniquely identify an <code>Endpoint</code>, this crate proposes the <code>EndpointId</code> type, which can be implemented as a wrapper around an <code>Address</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Clone, Copy, Eq, PartialEq, Hash)]
struct EndpointId(Address);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note, that this <code>EndpointId</code> should be <code>Clone</code> and <code>Copy</code>, and requires to implement <code>Eq</code>, <code>PartialEq</code>, and <code>Hash</code>, because it is used as a hashmap key in several instances.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#command" id="command"><code>Command</code></a></h2>
<p><code>Command</code>s are messages that are supposed to be issued by higher level business logic like a protocol layer. They are implemented as an <code>enum</code>, which in Rust is one way of expressing a polymorphic type:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>enum Command {
    // Adds an endpoint to the list.
    AddEndpoint { url: Url, ... },

    // Removes an endpoint from the list.
    RemoveEndpoint { epid: EndpointId, ... },

    // Attempts to connect to an endpoint.
    Connect { epid: EndpointId, ... },

    // Disconnects from an endpoint.
    Disconnect { epid: EndpointId, ... },

    // Sends a message to a particular endpoint.
    SendMessage { epid: EndpointId, bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt;, ... },

    // Sends a message to multiple endpoints.
    MulticastMessage { epids: Vec&lt;EndpointId&gt;, bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt;, ...},

    // Sends a message to all endpoints in its list.
    BroadcastMessage { bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt;, ... },
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This <code>enum</code> makes the things the consumer can do with the crate very explicit and descriptive, and also easily extensible.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#event" id="event"><code>Event</code></a></h3>
<p>Similarly to <code>Command</code>s, the different kinds of <code>Event</code>s in the system are implemented as an <code>enum</code> allowing various types of concrete events being sent over event channels:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[non_exhaustive]
enum Event {
    // An endpoint was added to the list.
    EndpointAdded { epid: EndpointId, ... },

    // An endpoint was removed from the list.
    EndpointRemoved { epid: EndpointId, ... },

    // A new connection is being set up.
    NewConnection { ep: Endpoint, ... },

    // A broken connection.
    LostConnection { epid: EndpointId },

    // An endpoint was successfully connected.
    EndpointConnected { epid: EndpointId, address: Address, ... },

    // An endpoint was disconnected.
    EndpointDisconnected { epid: EndpointId, ... },

    // A message was sent.
    MessageSent { epid: EndpointId, num_bytes: usize },

    // A message was received.
    MessageReceived { epid: EndpointId, bytes: Vec&lt;u8&gt; },

    // A connection attempt should occur.
    TryConnect { epid: EndpointId, ... },
}

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In contrast to <code>Command</code>s though, <code>Event</code>s are messages created by the system, and those that are considered relevant are published for the consumer to execute custom logic. It is attributed as <code>non_exhaustive</code> to accommodate for possible additions in the future.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#workers" id="workers">Workers</a></h2>
<p>There are two essential asynchronous workers in the system that are running for the application's whole lifetime. That is the <code>EndpointWorker</code> and the <code>TcpWorker</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#endpointworker" id="endpointworker">EndpointWorker</a></h3>
<p>This worker manages the list of <code>Endpoint</code>s and processes the <code>Command</code>s issued by the consumer of this crate, and publishes <code>Event</code>s to be consumed by the user.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#tcpworker" id="tcpworker">TcpWorker</a></h3>
<p>This worker is responsible for accepting incoming TCP connection requests from other endpoints. Once a connection is established two additional asynchronous tasks are spawned that respectively handle incoming and outgoing messages.</p>
<p>Note: connection attempts from unknown IP addresses (i.e. not part of the static whitelist) will be rejected.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#shutdown" id="shutdown">Shutdown</a></h2>
<p><code>Shutdown</code> is a <code>struct</code> that facilitates a graceful shutdown. It stores the sender halfs of <code>oneshot</code> channels (<code>ShutdownNotifier</code>) and the task handles (<code>WorkerTask</code>).</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Shutdown {
    notifiers: Vec&lt;ShutdownNotifier&gt;,
    tasks: Vec&lt;WorkerTask&gt;,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Apart from providing the necessary API to register channels and tasks, executing the shutdown happens by calling:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span>
<span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>async fn execute(self) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; { ... }

<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This method will then try to send a shutdown signal to all registered workers and wait for those tasks to complete.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#drawbacks-2" id="drawbacks-2">Drawbacks</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>This design might not be the most performant solution as it requires each byte message to be wrapped into a <code>SendMessage</code> command, that is then sent through a channel to the <code>EndpointWorker</code>. Proper benchmarking is necessary to determine if this design can be a performance bottleneck;</li>
<li>Currently UDP is not a requirement, so the proposal focuses on TCP only. Nonetheless, the crate is designed in way that allows for simple addition of UDP support;</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-2" id="rationale-and-alternatives-2">Rationale and alternatives</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>The reason for not choosing an already available crate, is that there aren't many crates yet, that are implemented in the proposed way, and are also widely used in the Rust ecosystem. Additionally we reduce dependencies, and have the option to tailor the crate exactly to our needs even on short notice;</li>
<li>There are many ways to implement such a crate, many of which are probably more performant than the proposed one. However, the main focus of this proposal is ease-of-use and extensibility. It leaves performance optimization to later versions and/or RFCs, when more data has been collected through stress tests and benchmarks;</li>
<li>In particular, the <code>Command</code> abstraction could be removed entirely, and replaced by an additional static function for each command. This might be a more efficient thing to do, but it is still unclear how much there is to be gained by doing this, and if this would be necessary taking into account the various other CPU expensive things like hashing, signature verification, etc, that a node needs to do;</li>
<li>Since mpsc channels are still unstable in <code>async_std</code> at the time of this writing, this RFC suggests using those from the <code>futures</code> crate. Once this has been stabilized, a swith to those channels might improve performance, since to the authors knowledge those are based on the more efficient <code>crossbeam</code> implementation;</li>
<li>To implement this RFC, any async library or mix can be used. Other options to consider are <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio"><code>tokio</code></a>, and for asynchronous channels <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/flume"><code>flume</code></a>. Using those libraries, might result in a much more efficient implementation;</li>
<li><code>EndpointId</code> may be something different than a wrapper around an <code>Address</code>, but instead be derived from some sort of cryptographic hash;</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions-2" id="unresolved-questions-2">Unresolved questions</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>The design has been tested in a prototype, and it seems to work reliably, so there are no unresolved questions in terms of the validity of this proposal;</li>
<li>It is still unclear - due to the lack of benchmark results - how efficient this design is; however, due to its asynchronous design it should be able to make use from multicore systems;</li>
<li>Handling of endpoints with dynamic IPs;</li>

<p>This RFC proposes the ternary <code>Hash</code> type, the <code>Sponge</code> trait, and two cryptographic hash functions <code>CurlP</code> and <code>Kerl</code>
implementing it. The 3 cryptographic hash functions used in the current IOTA networks (i.e. as of IOTA Reference
Implementation <code>iri v1.8.6</code>) are <code>Kerl</code>, <code>CurlP27</code>, and <code>CurlP81</code>.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation-3" id="motivation-3">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>In order to participate in the IOTA network, an application needs to be able to construct valid messages that can be
verified by other participants in the network. Among other operations, this is accomplished by validating transaction
signatures, transaction hashes and bundle hashes.</p>
<p>The two hash functions currently used are both sponge constructions: <code>CurlP</code>, which is specified entirely in balanced
ternary, and <code>Kerl</code>, which first converts ternary input to a binary representation, applies <code>keccak-384</code> to it, and then
converts its binary output back to ternary. For <code>CurlP</code> specifically, its variants <code>CurlP27</code> and <code>CurlP81</code> are used.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-3" id="detailed-design-3">Detailed design</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#hash" id="hash">Hash</a></h2>
<p>This RFC defines a ternary type <code>Hash</code> which is the base input and output of the <code>Sponge</code>.
The exact definition is an implementation detail but an example definition could
simply be the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Hash([i8; HASH_LENGTH]);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Where the length of a hash in units of binary-coded balanced trits would be defined as:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>const HASH_LENGTH: usize = 243;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#sponges" id="sponges">Sponges</a></h2>
<p><code>CurlP</code> and <code>Kerl</code> are cryptographic sponge constructions. They are equipped with a memory state and a function that
replaces the state memory using some input string. A portion of the memory state is then the output. In the sponge
metaphor, the process of replacing the memory state by an input string is said to <code>absorb</code> the input, while the process
of producing an output is said to <code>squeeze</code> out an output.</p>
<p>The hash functions are expected to be used like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>curlp</code></p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

let transaction = TritBuf::&lt;T1B1Buf&gt;::zeros(6561);
let mut hash = TritBuf::&lt;T1B1Buf&gt;::zeros(243);

// Absorb the transaction.
curlp.absorb(&amp;transaction);
// Squeeze out a hash.

<p>The main proposal of this RFC are the <code>Sponge</code> trait and the <code>CurlP</code> and <code>Kerl</code> types that are implementing it.
This RFC relies on the presence of the types <code>TritBuf</code> and <code>Trits</code>, as defined by
<a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/bee-rfcs/blob/master/text/0036-ternary.md">RFC36</a>, which are assumed to be owning and

<p>Following the sponge metaphor, an input provided by the user is <code>absorb</code>ed, and an output will be <code>squeeze</code>d from the
data structure. <code>digest</code> is a convenience method calling <code>absorb</code> and <code>squeeze</code> in one go. The <code>*_into</code> versions of
these methods are for passing a buffer, into which the calculated hashes are written. The internal state will not be
cleared unless <code>reset</code> is called.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#design-of-curlp" id="design-of-curlp">Design of <code>CurlP</code></a></h3>
<p><code>CurlP</code> is designed as a hash function, that acts on a <code>T1B1</code> binary-encoded ternary buffer, with a hash length of <code>243</code>
trits and an inner state of <code>729</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">

</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>const STATE_LENGTH: usize = HASH_LENGTH * 3;

<p>In addition, a lookup table is used as part of the absorption step:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th></th><th>-1</th><th>0</th><th>1</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>-1</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>0</strong></td><td>0</td><td>-1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>1</strong></td><td>-1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Given two balanced trits <code>t</code> and <code>t'</code>, the following table can easily be accessed by shifting them to unbalanced trits:</p>

<p>The way <code>CurlP</code> is defined, it can not actually fail, because the input or outputs can be of arbitrary size; hence,
the associated type <code>Error = Infallible</code>.</p>

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The actual cryptographic hash function underlying <code>Kerl</code> is <code>keccak-384</code>. The real task here is to transform an input
of 243 (balanced) trits to 384 bits in a correct and performant way. This is done by interpreting the 243 trits as a
signed integer <code>I</code> and converting it to a binary basis. In other words, the ternary encoded integer is expressed as the
series:</p>
<pre><code>I = t_0 * 3^0 + t_1 * 3^1 + ... + t_241 * 3^241 + t_242 * 3^242,
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>t_i</code> is the trit at the <code>i</code>-th position in the ternary input array. The challenge is then to convert this integer
to base <code>2</code>, i.e. find a a series such that:</p>
<pre><code>I = b_0 * 2^0 + b_1 * 2^1 + ... + b_382 * 2^382 + b_383 * 2^383,
</code></pre>
<p>with <code>b_i</code> the bit at the <code>i-th</code> position.</p>
<p>Assuming there exists an implementation of <code>keccak</code>, the main work in implementing <code>Kerl</code> is writing an efficient
converter between the ternary array interpreted as an integer, and its binary representation. For the binary
representation, one can either use an existing big-integer library, or write one from scratch with only a subset of
required methods to make the conversion work.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#important-implementation-details" id="important-implementation-details">Important implementation details</a></h4>
<p>When absorbing into the sponge the conversion flows like this (little and big are short for little and big endian,
respectively):</p>
<pre><code>Balanced t243 -&gt; unbalanced t242 -&gt; u32 little u384 -&gt; u32 little i384 -&gt; u8 big i384
</code></pre>
<p>When squeezing and thus converting back to ternary the conversion flows like this:</p>
<pre><code>u8 big i384 -&gt; u32 little i384 -&gt; u32 little u384 -&gt; unbalanced t243 -&gt; balanced t243 -&gt; balanced t242
</code></pre>
<p>These steps will now be explained in detail.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#conversion-is-done-via-accumulation" id="conversion-is-done-via-accumulation">Conversion is done via accumulation</a></h5>
<p>Because a number like <code>3^242</code> does not fit into any existing primitive, it needs to be constructed from scratch by
taking a <em>big integer</em>, setting its least significant number to <code>1</code>, and multiplying it by <code>3</code> <code>242</code> times. This is the
core of the conversion mechanism. Essentially, the polynomial used to express the integer in ternary can be rewritten
like this:</p>
<pre><code>I = t_0 * 3^0 + t_1 * 3^1 + ... + t_241 * 3^241 + t_242 * 3^242,
  = ((...((t_242 * 3 + t_241) * 3 + t_240) * 3 + ...) * 3 + t_1) * 3 + t_0
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, one iterates through the ternary buffer starting from the most significant trit, adds <code>t_242</code> onto the binary big
integer (initially filled with <code>0</code>s), and then keeps looping through it, multiplying it by 3 and adding the next <code>t_i</code>.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#conversion-is-done-in-unsigned-space" id="conversion-is-done-in-unsigned-space">Conversion is done in unsigned space</a></h5>
<p>First and foremost, IOTA is primarily written with balanced ternary in mind, meaning that each trit represents an
integer in the set <code>{-1, 0, +1}</code>. Because it is easier to do the conversion in positive space, the trits are shifted
into <em>unbalanced</em> space, by adding <code>+1</code> at each position, so that each unbalanced trit represents an integer in
<code>{0, 1, 2}</code>.</p>
<p>For example, the balanced ternary buffer (using only 9 trits to demonstrate the point) becomes after the shift (leaving
out signs in the unbalanced case):</p>
<pre><code>[0, -1, +1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, +1] -&gt; [1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2]
</code></pre>
<p>Remembering that each ternary array is actually some integer <code>I</code>, this is akin to adding another integer <code>H</code> to it, with
all trits in the ternary buffer representing it set to <code>1</code>, where <code>I'</code> is <code>I</code> shifted into unsigned space, and the
underscore <code>_t</code> means a ternary representation (either balanced or unbalanced):</p>
<pre><code>I_t + H_t = [0, -1, +1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, +1] + [+1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1, +1] = I'_t
</code></pre>
<p>After changing the base to binary using some function which would be called <code>to_bin</code> and which would be required to be
distributed over addition, <code>H</code> needs to be subtracted again. We use <code>_b</code> to signify a binary representation:</p>
<pre><code>I'_b = to_bin(I'_t) = to_bin(I_t + H_t) = to_bin(I_t) + to_bin(H_t) = I_b + H_b
=&gt;
I_b = I'_b - H_b
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, the addition of the ternary buffer filled with <code>1</code>s that shifts all trits into unbalanced space is
reverted after conversion to binary, where the buffer of <code>1</code>s is also converted to binary and then subtracted from the
binary unsigned big integer. The result then is the integer <code>I</code> in binary.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#243-trits-do-not-fit-into-384-bits" id="243-trits-do-not-fit-into-384-bits">243 trits do not fit into 384 bits</a></h5>
<p>Since 243 trits do not fit into 384 bits, a choice has to be made about how to treat the most significant trit.
For example, one could take the binary big integer, convert it to ternary, and then check if the 243 are smaller than
this converted maximum 384 bit big int. With <code>Kerl</code>, the choice was made to disregard the most significant trit, so that
one only ever converts 242 trits to 384 bits, which always fits.</p>
<p>For the direction <code>ternary -&gt; binary</code> this does not pose challenges, other than making sure that one sets the most
significant trit to <code>0</code> after the shift by applying <code>+1</code> (if one chooses to reuse the array of 243 trits), and by making
sure to subtract <code>H_b</code> (see previous section) with the most significant trit set to <code>0</code> and all others set to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The direction <code>binary -&gt; ternary</code> (the conversion of the 384-bit hash squeezed from keccak) is the challenging part: one
needs to ensure that the most significant trit is is set to 0 before the binary-encoded integer is converted to ternary.
However, this has to happen in binary space!</p>
<p>Take <code>J_b</code> as the 384 bit integer coming out of the sponge. Then after conversion to ternary, <code>to_ter(J_b) = J_t</code>, the
most significant trit (MST) of <code>J_t</code> might be <code>+1</code> or <code>-1</code>. However, since by convention the MST has to be 0, one needs
to check whether <code>J_b</code> would cause <code>J_t</code> to have its MST set after conversion. This is done the following way:</p>
<pre><code>if J_b &gt; to_bin([0, 1, 1, ..., 1]):
    J_b &lt;- J_b - to_bin([1, 0, 0, ..., 0])

if J_b &lt; (to_bin([0, 0, 0, ..., 0]) - to_bin([0, 1, 1, ..., 1])):
    J_b &lt;- J_b + to_bin([1, 0, 0, ..., 0])
</code></pre>
<h5><a class="header" href="#kerl-updates-the-inner-state-by-applying-logical-not" id="kerl-updates-the-inner-state-by-applying-logical-not">Kerl updates the inner state by applying logical not</a></h5>
<p>The upstream keccak implementation uses a complicated permutation to update the inner state of the sponge construction
after a hash was squeezed from it. <code>Kerl</code> opts to apply logical not, <code>!</code>, to the bytes squeezed from <code>keccak</code>, and
updating <code>keccak</code>'s inner state with these.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#design-and-implementation" id="design-and-implementation">Design and implementation</a></h4>
<p>The main goal of the implementation was to ensure that representation of the integer was cast into types. To that end,
the following ternary types are defined as wrappers around <code>TritBuf</code> (read <code>T243</code> the same way you would think of <code>u32</code>
or <code>i64</code>):</p>

<p>where <code>TritBuf</code>, <code>T1B1Buf</code>, and <code>Trit</code> are types and traits defined in the <code>bee-ternary</code> crate. The bound <code>Trit</code> ensures
that the structs only contain ternary buffers with <code>Btrit</code> (for balancer ternary), and <code>Utrit</code> (for unbalanced ternary).
Methods on <code>T242</code> and <code>T243</code> assume that the most significant trit is always in the last position (think “little
endian”).</p>
<p>For the binary representation of the integer, the types <code>I384</code> (“signed” integer akin to <code>i64</code>), and <code>U384</code> (“unsigned”
akin to <code>u64</code>) are defined:</p>

<p>This RFC introduces a logging library - <code>log</code> - and some recommendations on how to log in the Bee project.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation-4" id="motivation-4">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>Logging is done across almost all binary and library crates in the Bee project, so consistency is needed to provide a
better user experience.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-4" id="detailed-design-4">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p>Logging in Bee should be done through the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/log">log</a> crate (<code>A Rust library providing a lightweight logging facade</code>) which is the de-facto standard library for logging in the Rust ecosystem.</p>
<p>The <code>log</code> crate itself is just a frontend and supports the implementation of many different backends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It provides a single logging API that abstracts over the actual logging implementation. Libraries can use the logging
API provided by this crate, and the consumer of those libraries can choose the logging implementation that is most
suitable for its use case.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="header" href="#frontend" id="frontend">Frontend</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Libraries should link only to the log crate, and use the provided macros to log whatever information will be useful
to downstream consumers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>log</code> crate provides the following macros, from lowest priority to highest priority:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>trace!</code></li>
<li><code>debug!</code></li>
<li><code>info!</code></li>
<li><code>warn!</code></li>
<li><code>error!</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These macros have a usage similar to the <code>println!</code> macro.</p>
<p>A log request consists of a <code>target</code>, a <code>level</code>, and a <code>message</code>.</p>
<p>By default, the target represents the location of the log request, but may be overridden.</p>
<p>Example with default target:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

</span>info!(&quot;Connected to port {} at {} Mb/s&quot;, conn_info.port, conn_info.speed);

</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Example with overridden target:</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#backend" id="backend">Backend</a></h2>

<p>Executables should choose a logging implementation and initialize it early in the runtime of the program. Logging

<p>This RFC introduces both the API and implementation of the <code>bee-ternary</code>
crate, a general-purpose ternary manipulation crate written in Rust that may be
used to handle ternary data in the IOTA ecosystem.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation-5" id="motivation-5">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>Ternary has been a fundamental part of the IOTA technology and is used
throughout, including for fundamental features like wallet addresses and transaction
identification.</p>
<p>More information about ternary in IOTA can be found
<a href="https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/introduction/ternary">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note that the IOTA foundation is seeking to reduce the prevalence of ternary
in the IOTA protocol to better accomodate modern binary architectures. See
<a href="https://blog.iota.org/chrysalis-b9906ec9d2de">Chrysalis</a> for more information.</em></p>
<p>Manipulating ternary in an ergonomic manner on top of existing binary-driven
code can require complexity and, up until now, comes either with a lot of
boilerplate code, implementations that are difficult to verify as correct, or a
lack of features.</p>
<p><code>bee-ternary</code> seeks to become the canonical ternary crate in the Rust IOTA
ecosystem by providing an API that is efficient, ergonomic, and featureful all
at once.</p>
<p><code>bee-ternary</code> will allow IOTA developers to more easily write code that works
with ternary and allow the simplification of existing codebases through use of
the API.</p>
<p>Broadly, there are 3 main benefits that <code>bee-ternary</code> aims to provide
over use-specific implementations of ternary manipulation code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Ergonomics</strong>: The API should be trivial to use correctly and should
naturally guide developers towards correct and efficient solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Features</strong>: The API should provide a fundamental set of core features that
can be used together to cover most developer requirements. Examples of such
features include multiple encoding schemes, binary/ternary conversion,
(de)serialization, and tryte string de/encoding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance</strong>: The API should allow 'acceptably' efficient manipulation of
ternary data. This is difficult to ruggedly define, and implementation details
may change later, but broadly this RFC intends to introduce an API that does not
inherently inhibit high performance through poor design choices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-5" id="detailed-design-5">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p><code>bee-ternary</code> is designed to be extensible and is built on top of a handful of
fundamental abstraction types. Below are listed the features of the API and a
summary of the core API features.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#features" id="features">Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Efficient manipulation of ternary buffers (trits and trytes).</li>
<li>Multiple encoding schemes.</li>
<li>Extensible design that allows it to sit on top of existing data structures,
avoiding unnecessary allocation and copying.</li>
<li>An array of utility functions to allow for easy manipulation of ternary data.</li>
<li>Zero-cost conversion between trit and tryte formats (i.e: no slower than
the equivalent code would be if hand-written).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#key-types--traits" id="key-types--traits">Key Types &amp; Traits</a></h2>
<p>The crate supports both balanced and unbalanced trit representations, supported
through two types, <code>Btrit</code> and <code>Utrit</code>. <code>Btrit</code> is the more common
representation and so is the implicit default for most operations in the crate.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#api" id="api">API</a></h2>
<p>The API makes up the body of this RFC. Due to its considerable length, this RFC
simply refers to the documentation in question. You can find those docs in the
<code>bee</code> repository.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#encodings" id="encodings">Encodings</a></h2>
<p><code>bee-ternary</code> supports many different trit encodings. Notable encodings are
explained in the crate documentation.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#common-patterns" id="common-patterns">Common Patterns</a></h2>
<p>When using the API, the most common types interacted with are <code>Trits</code> and
<code>TritBuf</code>. These types are designed to play well with the rest of the Rust
ecosystem. Here follows some examples of common patterns that you may wish to
make use of.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#turning-some-i8s-into-a-trit-buffer" id="turning-some-i8s-into-a-trit-buffer">Turning some <code>i8</code>s into a trit buffer</a></h3>

<p>Alternatively, for the <code>T1B1</code> encoding only, you may directly reinterpret the

<p>If you are <em>certain</em> that the slice contains <em>only</em> valid trits then it is
possible to unsafely reinterpret with amortised O(1) cost (i.e: it's basically
free). However, scenarios in which this is necessary and sound are exceedingly
uncommon. If you find yourself doing this, ask yourself first whether it is
necessary.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#summary-7" id="summary-7">Summary</a></h1>
<p>This RFC proposes a unified way of achieving a graceful shutdown of arbitrarily many async workers and their utilized resources in the Bee framework.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation-7" id="motivation-7">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>Rust provides one of the most powerful, performant, and still safest abstractions to deal with <em>concurrency</em>. You can read about Rust's concurrency story <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>One problem that arises when dealing with many asynchronous tasks within a system is to ensure that all of them terminate gracefully once an agreed upon shutdown signal was issued. An example for this is when a software intercepts the press of <code>^C</code> in the terminal, and then executes specialized instructions to prevent data corruption before finally exiting the application.</p>
<p>This feature solves this problem by introducing a type called <code>Shutdown</code>, that allows to register ansynchronous workers, and <code>execute</code> a shutdown in a 3-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send a shutdown signal to all registered workers;</li>
<li>Wait for all the workers to terminate;</li>
<li>Perform final actions (like flushing buffers to databases, saving files, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-7" id="detailed-design-7">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p>As the shutdown signal itself contains no data, the zero-sized unit type <code>()</code> is used to model it. Furthermore, as the synchronizing mechanism, this RFC proposes the use of <code>oneshot</code> channels from the <code>futures</code> crate. Those channels are consumed, i.e. destroyed, when calling <code>send</code> once; this way Rust ensures at compile-time, that no further redundant shutdown signals can be sent to the same listener.</p>
<p>To make the code more readable and less verbose, this RFC proposes the following type aliases:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// The &quot;notifier&quot; is the origin of the shutdown signal. For each spawned worker a
// dedicated notifier will be created and kept in a list.
type ShutdownNotifier = oneshot::Sender&lt;()&gt;;

// The &quot;listener&quot; is the receiver of the shutdown signal. It awaits the shutdown
// signal as part of the event loop of the corresponding worker.
type ShutdownListener = oneshot::Receiver&lt;()&gt;;

// For each async worker the async runtime creates a `Future`, that completes when the
// worker terminates, i.e. shuts down. To make sure, the shutdown is complete, one has
// to store those `Future`s in a list, and await all of them iteratively before exiting
// the program.
type WorkerShutdown = Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output = Result&lt;(), WorkerError&gt;&gt; + Unpin&gt;;

// Before shutting down a system, workers oftentimes need to perform one or more final
// actions to prevent data loss and/or data corruption. Therefore each worker can register
// an arbitrary amount of actions, that will be executed as the final step of the shutdown
// process.
type Action = Box&lt;dyn FnOnce()&gt;;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>WorkerShutdown</code> and <code>Action</code> are boxed trait objects; hence have a single owner, and are stored on the heap. The <code>Unpin</code> marker trait requirement ensures that the given trait object can be moved into the internal datastructure. If the worker terminates with an error, it will be wrapped by a variant of the <code>WorkerError</code> enum. If the worker terminates without any error, <code>()</code> is returned - this time indicating that the worker doesn't produce a return value.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#shutdown-1" id="shutdown-1"><code>Shutdown</code></a></h2>
<p>The shutdown functionality can be implemented using only one central type, that essentially is an append-only registry with a single <code>execute</code> operation. There is no need for removal, or identifying single items as the operation is applied to all of them equally, and once done, the whole program can be expected to terminate.</p>
<p>This <code>Shutdown</code> type looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Shutdown {
    // A list of all registered shutdown signal senders, briefly labeled as &quot;notifiers&quot;.
    notifiers: Vec&lt;ShutdownNotifier&gt;,

    // A list of all registered worker termination `Future`s.
    worker_shutdowns: Vec&lt;WorkerShutdown&gt;,

    // A list of all registered finalizing actions performed once all async workers
    // have terminated.
    actions: Vec&lt;Action&gt;,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The API of <code>Shutdown</code> is very small. It only needs to allow filling those internal lists, and provide an <code>execute</code> method to facilitate the actual shutdown:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl Shutdown {

    // Creates a new instance
    fn new() -&gt; Self {
        Self::default()
    }

    // Registers a worker shutdown future, which completes once the worker terminates in one
    // way or another, and registers a shutdown notification channel by providing its sender half.
    fn add_worker_shutdown(
        &amp;mut self,
        notifier: ShutdownNotifier,
        worker: impl Future&lt;Output = Result&lt;(), WorkerError&gt;&gt; + Unpin + 'static,
    ) {
        self.notifiers.push(notifier);

<p>About the <code>execute</code> method there are three things worth mentioning:</p>
<ol>
<li>takes <code>self</code> by value - in other words - claims ownership over the <code>Shutdown</code> instance, which means that it will be deallocated at the end of the method body, and can no longer be used;</li>
<li>is decorated with the <code>async</code> keyword, which means that under the hood it returns a <code>Future</code> that needs to be polled by an async runtime in order to make progress. In this specific case of a shutdown it almost always makes sense to <code>block_on</code> this method;</li>
<li>workers shut down in reverse order as they registered;</li>
</ol>

<li>Start date: 2020-07-03</li>

<h1><a class="header" href="#summary-8" id="summary-8">Summary</a></h1>
<p>This RFC introduces two <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">procedural macros</a>, <code>SecretDebug</code>
and <code>SecretDisplay</code>, to derive the traits <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html">Debug</a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html">Display</a> for secret material types in order to avoid leaking
their internals.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#motivation-8" id="motivation-8">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>Secret materials, private keys for example, are types that are expected to remain private and be shared/leaked under no
circumstances. However, these types may be wrapped in other higher level types, a wallet for example, that may want to
implement <code>Debug</code> and/or <code>Display</code>. Not implementing these traits on the secret types would then not permit it.
At the same time, secret materials should not be exposed by logging them. The consensus is then to implement <code>Debug</code> and
<code>Display</code> but to not actually log the inner secret. To make things easier, two procedural macros are proposed to
automatically derive  such implementations.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-8" id="detailed-design-8">Detailed design</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#crate" id="crate">Crate</a></h2>
<p>Procedural macros need to be defined in a different type of crate so a new dedicated crate has to be created with the following in its <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[lib]
proc-macro = true
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#derivation" id="derivation">Derivation</a></h2>
<p>This feature is expected to be used by deriving <code>SecretDebug</code> and/or <code>SecretDisplay</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(SecretDebug, SecretDisplay)]
struct PrivateKey {
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#output" id="output">Output</a></h2>
<p>When an attempt to display or debug a secret type is made, a generic message should be displayed instead.
This RFC proposes <code>&lt;Omitted secret&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation" id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>This feature makes use of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/syn">syn</a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/quote">quote</a> crates to
create derivation macros.</p>
<p>Implementation of <code>SecretDebug</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[proc_macro_derive(SecretDebug)]
pub fn derive_secret_debug(input: proc_macro::TokenStream) -&gt; proc_macro::TokenStream {
    // Parse the input tokens into a syntax tree.
    let input = parse_macro_input!(input as DeriveInput);
    // Used in the quasi-quotation below as `#name`.
    let name = input.ident;
    // Get the different implementation elements from the input.
    let (impl_generics, ty_generics, _) = input.generics.split_for_impl();

    let expanded = quote! {
        // The generated implementation.
        impl #impl_generics std::fmt::Debug for #name #ty_generics {
            fn fmt(&amp;self, f: &amp;mut std::fmt::Formatter&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; std::fmt::Result {
                write!(f, &quot;&lt;Omitted secret&gt;&quot;)
            }
        }

<p>Implementation of <code>SecretDisplay</code> is similar.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#drawbacks-8" id="drawbacks-8">Drawbacks</a></h1>
<p>User may actually really want to debug/display their secret types. With this feature in place, they would have to rely
on APIs providing getters to the inner secret and/or serialization primitives.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives-8" id="rationale-and-alternatives-8">Rationale and alternatives</a></h1>
<p>By providing macros, we offer a consistent way to approach the problem and potentially reduce the risk of users leaking
their secret materials by accident.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions-8" id="unresolved-questions-8">Unresolved questions</a></h1>
<p>No questions at the moment.</p>
