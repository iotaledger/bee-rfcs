# Summary

<!-- TODO: 81 rounds? rounds of what? -->

This RFC proposes the implementation of the cryptographic hash functions
`CurlP` and `Kerl`, and the `Sponge` trait as a common interface. The 3
cryptographic hash functions used by the IOTA reference implementation `iri
v1.8.1` are `Kerl`, `CurlP27`, and `CurlP81`, the latter being newtypes around
`CurlP` with 27 and 81 rounds, respectively.

`CurlP` is used for generating transaction hashes and --- through the
`PearlDiver` algorithm --- for proof of work calculations. While `CurlP27` is
used in the testnet, `CurlP81` is used for production in the mainnet. `Kerl` on
the other hand is used as part of all other operations requiring cryptographic
security, namely address generation, signature generation and verification, and
bundle hash calculation. It is also used for coordinator to produce milestones
on the mainnet.

This design is going to be the common interface of any sponge function. Users can expect each hash instance to provide

# Motivation

One goal of the `bee` project is to make it possible to write nodes that are able to run on the current main net of
IOTA. Nodes comprising the current main net are either implemented using the IOTA reference implementation, version `iri
v1.8.1`, or using libraries compatible with it.

In order to participate in the IOTA network, a node needs be able to construct valid messages that can be verified by
other nodes in the network. Conversely, a node needs to be able to verify other nodes' messages. IOTA messages are
called *bundles* and consist of one or more *transactions*. A transaction is a fixed-size binary object that itself is
partitioned into several fixed-size fields. A *valid* transaction then is a transaction with fields containing correctly
calculated hashes, signatures, and nonce values. For an overview of the different fields of a transaction, see the
documents on [IOTA transactions and bundle].

For example, a transaction that withdraws funds from an IOTA address needs to have the following set correctly:

<!-- TODO: go into a bit more detail how and which hashes are used below -->

- signature
- address
- bundle hash
- nonce

The cryptographic hash functions used in `iri v1.8.1` are `CurlP27`, `CurlP81`,
and `Kerl`, which are all sponge constructions. A simplistic (and not at all
complete) summary is that these are functions that are equipped with a memory
state and a function that replaces the state memory using some input string
(which can be the state memory itself). A portion of the memory state is then
the output. In the sponge metaphor, the process of replacing the memory state
by an input string is said to *absorb* the input, while the process of
producing an output is said to *squeeze out* an output.  This RFC hence
proposes a `Sponge` trait, and the `CurlP` and `Kerl` sponge constructions that
are implemented in terms of it.

The hashes are expected to be used like this:

```rust
// Create a CurlP instance with 81 rounds.
// This is equivalent to calling `CurlP::new(81)`.
let mut curlp = CurlP81::new();

// Assume this is a transaction and we want to digest a hash.
let transaction = [0i8; 8019];
let mut tx_hash = [0i8; 243];

// Absorb the transaction.
curlp.absorb(&transaction);
// And squeeze into the `tx_hash` buffer.
curlp.squeeze_into(&mut tx_hash);
```
```rust
// Create a Kerl instance. Kerl does not come with a configurable number of rounds.
let mut kerl = Kerl::new();

// `Kerl::digest` is a function that combines `Kerl::absorb` and `Kerl::squeeze`. `Kerl::digest_into`
// combines `Kerl::absorb` with `Kerl::squeeze_into`. `CurlP` provides the same methods.
let tx_hash = kerl.digest(&transaction);
```

# Detailed design

The cryptographic hash functions in this RFC are implemented in terms of the `Sponge` trait:

```rust
trait Sponge {
    // Absorb `input` into the sponge
    fn absorb(&mut self, input: &[i8]);

    // Reset the inner state of the sponge
    fn reset(&mut self);

    // Squeeze the sponge into a buffer
    fn squeeze_into(&mut self, buf: &mut [i8])

    // Squeeze the sponge and return the output
    fn squeeze(&mut self) -> Vec<i8> {
        let mut output: Vec::new();
        self.squeeze_into(&mut output);
        output
    }

    // Convenience function to absorb `input` and squeeze the sponge into a buffer in one go.
    fn digest_into(&mut self, input: &[i8], buf: &mut [i8])
        self.absorb(input);
        self.squeeze_into(buf);
    }

    // Convenience function to absorb `input` and squeeze the sponge in one go, returning the output
    fn digest(&mut self, input: &[i8]) -> Vec<i8> {
        self.absorb(input);
        self.squeeze();
    }
}
```

at least these public methods. Following the sponge metaphor, an input reference provided by the user is `absorb`ed, and
an output will be `squeeze`d from the data structure. `digest` is a convenience method calling `absorb` and `squeeze` in
one go. The `*_into` versions of these methods are for providing a buffer into which the calculated hashes are written.
The internal state will not be cleared unless `reset` is called. 

## Design of `CurlP`

`CurlP` is designed as a hash function that acts on `t1b1` binary-encoded
ternary (meaning that one trit is encoded by one byte), with a hash length of `243` trits and an inner
state of `729` trits, which we take as constants:

```rust
const HASH_LENGTH: usize = 243;
const STATE_LENGTH: usize = HASH_LENGTH * 3;
```

In addition, a lookup table is used as part of the absorption step:

```rust
pub const TRUTH_TABLE: [i8; 11] = [1, 0, -1, 2, 1, -1, 0, 2, -1, 1, 0];
```

**TODO:** Can we better explain the logic behind the truth table?

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct CurlP {
    /// The number of rounds of hashing to apply before a hash is squeezed.
    rounds: usize,

    /// The internal state.
    state: [i8; STATE_LENGTH],
}
```

```rust
impl CurlP {
    /// Create a new `CurlP` sponge with `rounds` of iterations.
    pub fn new(rounds: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            rounds,
            state: [i8; STATE_LENGTH],
        }
    }

    /// Return the number of rounds used in this `CurlP` instacnce.
    pub fn rounds(&self) -> usize {
        self.usize
    }

    fn transform(&mut self) {
        let mut local_state: [i8; STATE_LENGTH] = [0; STATE_LENGTH];

        for round in 0..self.rounds {
            let (state_out, state) = if round % 2 == 0 {
                (&mut local_state, &self.state)
            } else {
                (&mut self.state, &local_state)
            };

            for state_index in 0..STATE_LENGTH {
                let idx: usize = (state[TRANSFORM_INDICES[state_index]] as usize)
                    .wrapping_add((state[TRANSFORM_INDICES[state_index + 1]] as usize) << 2)
                    .wrapping_add(5);

                state_out[state_index] = TRUTH_TABLE[idx];
            }
        }
}
```

```rust
impl Sponge for CurlP {
    pub fn absorb(&mut self, input: &[i8]) {
        for c in input.chunks(HASH_LENGTH) {
            self.state[0..c.len()].copy_from_slice(c);
            self.transform();
        }
    }

    /// Reset the sponge to initial state
    pub fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.state = [0; STATE_SIZE];
    }

    /// Squeeze trits out of the sponge and copy them into `out`
    pub fn squeeze_into(&mut self, buf: &mut [i8]) {
        let trit_count = buf.len();
        let hash_count = trit_count / HASH_LENGTH;

        for i in 0..hash_count {
            buf[i * HASH_LENGTH..(i + 1) * HASH_LENGTH]
                .copy_from_slice(&self.state[0..HASH_LENGTH]);
            self.transform();
        }

        let last = trit_count - hash_count * HASH_LENGTH;
        buf[trit_count - last..].copy_from_slice(&self.state[0..last]);
        if trit_count % HASH_LENGTH != 0 {
            self.transform();
        }
    }
}
```

In addition, there are two wrapper types for the very common `CurlP` variants with `27` and `81`:

```rust
struct CurlP27(CurlP);

impl CurlP27 {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self(CurlP::new(27))
    }
}

struct CurlP81(CurlP);

impl CurlP81 {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self(CurlP::new(81))
    }
}
```

## Design of `Kerl`

```rust
/// Kerl is wrapper for Keccak to hash ternary inputs.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Kerl(Keccak);

impl Kerl {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self(Keccak::new_keccak384())
    }
}

impl Sponge for Kerl {
    pub fn absorb(&mut self, trits: &[i8]) {
        assert_eq!(trits.len() % TRIT_LENGTH, 0);
        let mut bytes: [i8; BYTE_LENGTH] = [0; BYTE_LENGTH];

        for chunk in trits.chunks(TRIT_LENGTH) {
            trits_to_bytes(chunk, &mut bytes);
            self.0.update(&bytes);
        }
    }

    pub fn squeeze_into(&mut self, buf: &mut [i8]) {
        assert_eq!(buf.len() % TRIT_LENGTH, 0);
        let mut bytes: [i8; BYTE_LENGTH] = [0; BYTE_LENGTH];

        for chunk in buf.chunks_mut(TRIT_LENGTH) {
            self.0.pad();
            self.0.fill_block();
            self.0.squeeze(&mut bytes);
            self.reset();
            bytes_to_trits(&mut bytes.to_vec(), chunk);
            for b in bytes.iter_mut() {
                *b = *b ^ 0xFF;
            }
            self.0.update(&bytes);
        }
    }

    pub fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.0 = Keccak::new_keccak384();
    }
}
```

# Drawbacks

+ Ternary is only handled within the crate as there is currently no common interface for it. Thus the present hashing
  functions will perform extra operations which is not ideal when called repeatedly.

# Rationale and alternatives

+ `CurlP` and `Kerl` are fundamental to the `iri v1.8.1` main net. They are thus essential for compatibility with it.
+ These types are idiomatic in Rust, and users are not required to know the implementation details of each hash
  algorithm.

## Alternatives

# Unresolved questions

+ Parameters are slice reference in both input and output. Do we want to consume value or create a new instance as
+ return values?
+ Implementation of each hash functions and other utilities like HMAC should have separate RFCs for them.
+ Decision on implementation of `Troika` is still unknown.
+ Can (should?) the `CurlP` algorithm be explained in more detail?
