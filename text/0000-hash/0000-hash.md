# Summary

This RFC proposes the implementation of the cryptographic hash functions `CurlP` and `Kerl`, and the `Sponge` trait as a
common interface. The 3 cryptographic hash functions used by the IOTA reference implementation `iri v1.8.1` are `Kerl`,
`CurlP27`, and `CurlP81`, the latter being newtypes around `CurlP` with 27 and 81 rounds (iterations of sponge function
taken), respectively.

`CurlP` is used for generating transaction hashes and --- through the `PearlDiver` algorithm --- for proof of work
calculations. While `CurlP27` is used in the testnet, `CurlP81` is used for production in the mainnet. `Kerl` on the
other hand is used as part of all other operations requiring cryptographic security, namely address generation,
signature generation and verification, and bundle hash calculation. It is also used for coordinator to produce
milestones on the mainnet.

This design is going to be the common interface of any sponge function. Users can expect each hash instance to provide

# Motivation

One goal of the `bee` project is to make it possible to write nodes that are able to run on the current main net of
IOTA. Nodes comprising the current main net are either implemented using the IOTA reference implementation, version `iri
v1.8.1`, or using libraries compatible with it.

In order to participate in the IOTA network, a node needs be able to construct valid messages that can be verified by
other nodes in the network. Conversely, a node needs to be able to verify other nodes' messages. IOTA messages are
called *bundles* and consist of one or more *transactions*. A transaction is a fixed-size binary object that itself is
partitioned into several fixed-size fields. A *valid* transaction then is a transaction with fields containing correctly
calculated hashes, signatures, and nonce values. For an overview of the different fields of a transaction, see the
documents on [IOTA transactions and bundle].

For example, a transaction that withdraws funds from an IOTA address needs to have the following set correctly:

- [signatures](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/signatures)
- [addresses](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/addresses)
- [bundle hash (see Bundle essence)](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/bundles)
- [nonce](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/transactions/proof-of-work)

The cryptographic hash functions used in `iri v1.8.1` are `CurlP27`, `CurlP81`, and `Kerl`, which are all sponge
constructions. A simplistic (and not at all complete) summary is that these are functions that are equipped with a
memory state and a function that replaces the state memory using some input string (which can be the state memory
itself). A portion of the memory state is then the output. In the sponge metaphor, the process of replacing the memory
state by an input string is said to *absorb* the input, while the process of producing an output is said to *squeeze
out* an output.  This RFC hence proposes a `Sponge` trait, and the `CurlP` and `Kerl` sponge constructions that are
implemented in terms of it.

The hashes are expected to be used like this:

```rust
// Create a CurlP instance with 81 rounds.
// This is equivalent to calling `CurlP::new(81)`.
let mut curlp = CurlP81::new();

// Assume this is a transaction and we want to digest a hash.
let transaction = [0i8; 8019];
let mut tx_hash = [0i8; 243];

// Absorb the transaction.
curlp.absorb(&Trits::from_i8_unchecked(&transaction));
// And squeeze into the `tx_hash` buffer.
curlp.squeeze_into(&mut tx_hash);
```
```rust
// Create a Kerl instance. Kerl does not come with a configurable number of rounds.
let mut kerl = Kerl::new();

// `Kerl::digest` is a function that combines `Kerl::absorb` and `Kerl::squeeze`. `Kerl::digest_into`
// combines `Kerl::absorb` with `Kerl::squeeze_into`. `CurlP` provides the same methods.
let tx_hash = kerl.digest(&transaction);
```

# Detailed design

The main proposal of this RFC are the `Sponge` trait and the `CurlP` and `Kerl`
types that are implemented in terms of it. Additionally, this RFC includes the `Trits`,
`TritsMut`, and `TritsBuf` types to represent balanced binary-coded ternary in the `t1b1`
representation (which means that one trit is represented by one byte).

```rust
/// The common interface of cryptographic hash functions that follow the sponge construction and that
/// act on ternary.
trait Sponge {
    /// Absorb `input` into the sponge
    fn absorb(&mut self, input: &Trits);

    /// Reset the inner state of the sponge
    fn reset(&mut self);

    /// Squeeze the sponge into a buffer
    fn squeeze_into(&mut self, buf: &mut TritsMut);

    /// Squeeze the sponge and construct a new output
    fn squeeze(&mut self) -> TritsBuf {
        let mut output: Vec::new();
        self.squeeze_into(&mut output);
        output
    }

    // Convenience function to absorb `input`, squeeze the sponge into a
    // buffer, and reset the sponge.
    fn digest_into(&mut self, input: &Trits, buf: &mut TritsMut);
        self.absorb(input);
        self.squeeze_into(buf);
        self.reset();
    }

    // Convenience function to absorb `input`, squeeze the sponge constructing
    // a new output, and reseting the sponge.
    fn digest(&mut self, input: &Trits) -> TritsBuf {
        self.absorb(input);
        self.squeeze();
        self.reset();
    }
}
```

Following the sponge metaphor, an input reference provided by the user is
`absorb`ed, and an output will be `squeeze`d from the data structure. `digest`
is a convenience method calling `absorb` and `squeeze` in one go. The `*_into`
versions of these methods are for passing a buffer into which the calculated
hashes are written.  The internal state will not be cleared unless `reset` is
called. 

## Design of `CurlP`

`CurlP` is designed as a hash function that acts on `t1b1` binary-encoded
ternary (meaning that one trit is encoded by one byte), with a hash length of `243` trits and an inner
state of `729` trits, which we take as constants:

```rust
const HASH_LENGTH: usize = 243;
const STATE_LENGTH: usize = HASH_LENGTH * 3;
```

In addition, a lookup table is used as part of the absorption step. 2 is used to pad the table since there are only 9
combinations should be taken:

<!-- TODO: Convert this to a `TritsBuf` -->

```rust
pub const TRUTH_TABLE: [i8; 11] = [1, 0, -1, 2, 1, -1, 0, 2, -1, 1, 0];
```

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct CurlP {
    /// The number of rounds of hashing to apply before a hash is squeezed.
    rounds: usize,

    /// The internal state.
    state: TritsBuf,
}
```

```rust
impl CurlP {
    /// Create a new `CurlP` sponge with `rounds` of iterations.
    pub fn new(rounds: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            rounds,
            state: TritsBuf::with_capacity(STATE_LENGTH),
        }
    }

    /// Return the number of rounds used in this `CurlP` instacnce.
    pub fn rounds(&self) -> usize {
        self.usize
    }

    fn transform(&mut self) {
        let mut local_state = TritsBuf::with_capacity(STATE_LENGTH);

        for round in 0..self.rounds {
            let (state_out, state) = if round % 2 == 0 {
                (&mut local_state, &self.state)
            } else {
                (&mut self.state, &local_state)
            };

            for state_index in 0..STATE_LENGTH {
                let idx: usize =
                    (state[TRANSFORM_INDICES[state_index]] as usize)
                    .wrapping_add((state[TRANSFORM_INDICES[state_index + 1]] as usize) << 2)
                    .wrapping_add(5);

                state_out[state_index] = TRUTH_TABLE[idx];
            }
        }
}
```

```rust
impl Sponge for CurlP {
    pub fn absorb(&mut self, input: &Trits) {
        for c in input.chunks(HASH_LENGTH) {
            self.state[0..c.len()].copy_from_slice(c);
            self.transform();
        }
    }

    /// Reset the sponge to initial state
    pub fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.state = TritsBuf::with_capacity(STATE_SIZE);
    }

    /// Squeeze trits out of the sponge and copy them into `out`
    pub fn squeeze_into(&mut self, buf: &mut [i8]) {
        let trit_count = buf.len();
        let hash_count = trit_count / HASH_LENGTH;

        for i in 0..hash_count {
            buf[i * HASH_LENGTH..(i + 1) * HASH_LENGTH]
                .copy_from_slice(&self.state[0..HASH_LENGTH]);
            self.transform();
        }

        let last = trit_count - hash_count * HASH_LENGTH;
        buf[trit_count - last..].copy_from_slice(&self.state[0..last]);
        if trit_count % HASH_LENGTH != 0 {
            self.transform();
        }
    }
}
```

In addition, there are two wrapper types for the very common `CurlP` variants with `27` and `81`:

```rust
struct CurlP27(CurlP);

impl CurlP27 {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self(CurlP::new(27))
    }
}

struct CurlP81(CurlP);

impl CurlP81 {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self(CurlP::new(81))
    }
}
```

## Design of `Kerl`

```rust
/// Kerl is wrapper for Keccak to hash ternary inputs.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct Kerl(Keccak);

impl Kerl {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self(Keccak::new_keccak384())
    }
}

impl Sponge for Kerl {
    pub fn absorb(&mut self, trits: &[i8]) {
        assert_eq!(trits.len() % TRIT_LENGTH, 0);
        let mut bytes: [i8; BYTE_LENGTH] = [0; BYTE_LENGTH];

        for chunk in trits.chunks(TRIT_LENGTH) {
            trits_to_bytes(chunk, &mut bytes);
            self.0.update(&bytes);
        }
    }

    pub fn squeeze_into(&mut self, buf: &mut [i8]) {
        assert_eq!(buf.len() % TRIT_LENGTH, 0);
        let mut bytes: [i8; BYTE_LENGTH] = [0; BYTE_LENGTH];

        for chunk in buf.chunks_mut(TRIT_LENGTH) {
            self.0.pad();
            self.0.fill_block();
            self.0.squeeze(&mut bytes);
            self.reset();
            bytes_to_trits(&mut bytes.to_vec(), chunk);
            for b in bytes.iter_mut() {
                *b = *b ^ 0xFF;
            }
            self.0.update(&bytes);
        }
    }

    pub fn reset(&mut self) {
        self.0 = Keccak::new_keccak384();
    }
}
```

## Design of binary-coded ternary

`TritsBuf`, `Trits`, and `TritsMut` are intended to be thin newtype wrappers around
`Vec<i8>`, `&[i8]`, and `&mut [i8]` to ensure that the containers only contain
valid data.

Conversion from these types are implemented in terms of `TryFrom`, which checks
if each integer is `-1`, `0`, or `+1`. The newtypes also contain escape hatches
from the validation prior to conversion in the form of the `from_u8_unchecked`
and `from_i8_unchecked` methods. These are provided for when performance is a concern,
which is expected to be the case as these hashing functions will be used in tight loops.

Given that these types are wrappers around `Vec` and slices, they should implement all
traits that makes them usable in a similar way. This RFC doesn't provide example implementations,
but the following is a non-exhaustive list of traits that will be required (in particular, for
conveniently implementing the sponges presented here):

+ `std::ops::Index` and the associated `std::slice::SliceIndex`;
+ `std::ops::Deref` to derefence a `TritsBuf` into `Trits`;
+ `std::iter::Iterator`;

```rust
pub struct TritsBuf(Vec<i8>);
pub struct Trits<'a>(&'a [i8]);
pub struct TritsMut<'a>(&'a mut [i8]);

struct FromU8Error;
struct FromI8Error;

// Similar impls for `TritsMut` and `TritsBuf`
impl<'a> Trits<'a> {
    pub fn from_i8_unchecked(v: &[i8]) -> Self {
        Trits(v)
    }

    pub fn from_u8_unchecked(v: &[u8]) -> Self {
        from_i8_unchecked(unsafe {
            &*(self as *const _ as *const [i8])
        })
    }
}

impl TritsBuf {
    /// Create a new `TritsBuf` with a number of `capacity` elements, all
    /// initialized to 0;
    pub fn with_capacity(capacity: usize) -> Self {
        Self(vec![0; usize])
    }
}


impl<'_> TryFrom<&'_ u8> for Trits {
    type Error = FromU8Error;

    fn try_from(self) -> Result<Trits, Self::Error> {
        for byte in self {
            match byte {
                0b0000_0000 | 0b1111_1111 | 0b0000_0001 => {},
                _ => Err(FromU8Error)?,
            }
        }

        Ok( Trits::from_u8_unchecked(self) )
        })
    }
}
```

# Drawbacks

+ Ternary is only handled within the crate as there is currently no common interface for it. Thus the present hashing
  functions will perform extra operations which is not ideal when called repeatedly.

# Rationale and alternatives

+ `CurlP` and `Kerl` are fundamental to the `iri v1.8.1` main net. They are thus essential for compatibility with it.
+ These types are idiomatic in Rust, and users are not required to know the implementation details of each hash
  algorithm.

## Alternatives

# Unresolved questions

+ Parameters are slice reference in both input and output. Do we want to consume value or create a new instance as
  return values?
+ Implementation of each hash functions and other utilities like HMAC should have separate RFCs for them.
+ Decision on implementation of `Troika` is still unknown.
+ Can (should?) the `CurlP` algorithm be explained in more detail?
+ The truth table should be expressed in terms of `TritsBuf`
