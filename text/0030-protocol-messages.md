# Summary

This RFC introduces the IOTA protocol messages that were initially added in
[IRI#1393](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri/pull/1393).

# Motivation

To be able to take part in the IOTA networks, Bee nodes need to implement the exact same protocol presented in this RFC
and currently being used by [IRI](https://github.com/iotaledger/iri) nodes and
[HORNET](https://github.com/gohornet/hornet) nodes. However, it does not necessarily mean implementing the same versions
of the protocol. A design decision - later explained - concludes that Bee nodes and IRI nodes will not be able to
communicate with each other.

# Detailed design

This section details:
- The `Message` trait that provides serialization and deserialization of messages to and from byte buffers;
- A type-length-value protocol - on top of the trait - that adds metadata in order to send and receive the messages over
  a transport layer;
- The current `Message` implementations representing handshake, requests, responses, events, ...;

## `Message` trait

The `Message` trait is protocol agnostic and only provides serialization and deserialization to and from byte buffers.
It should not be used as is but rather be paired with a higher layer - like a type-length-value encoding - and as such
does not provide any bounds check on inputs/outputs buffers.

```rust
/// A trait describing the behavior of a message.
trait Message {
    /// The unique identifier of the message within the protocol.
    const ID: u8;

    /// Returns the size range of the message as it can be compressed.
    fn size_range() -> Range<usize>;

    /// Deserializes a byte buffer into a message.
    /// Panics if the provided buffer has an invalid size.
    /// The size of the buffer should be within the range returned by the `size_range` method.
    fn from_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Self;

    /// Returns the size of the message.
    fn size(&self) -> usize;

    /// Serializes a message into a byte buffer.
    /// Panics if the provided buffer has an invalid size.
    /// The size of the buffer should be equal to the one returned by the `size` method.
    fn into_bytes(self, bytes: &mut [u8]);
}
```

**Notes**:
- `size_range` returns an allowed range for the message size because some parts of some messages can be trimmed. It is
  used to check if a message coming from a transport layer has a valid size. More details on compression below;
- `from_bytes`/`into_bytes` panic if incorrectly used, only the following safe TLV module should directly use them;
- `into_bytes` does not allocate a buffer because the following TLV protocol implies concatenating a header inducing
  another allocation. Since this is a hot path, a slice of an already allocated buffer for both the header and payload
  is expected; hence, limiting the amount of allocation to the bare minimum;

## Type-length-value protocol

The [type-length-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value) module is a safe layer on top of the messages.
It allows serialization/deserialization to/from a byte buffer ready to be sent/received to/from a transport layer by
prepending or reading a header containing the type and length of the payload.

### Header

```rust
/// A header for the type-length-value encoding.
struct Header {
    /// Type of the message.
    message_type: u8,
    /// Length of the message.
    message_length: u16,
}
```

### Methods

```rust
/// Deserializes a TLV header and a byte buffer into a message.
/// * The advertised message type should match the required message type.
/// * The advertised message length should match the buffer length.
/// * The buffer length should be within the allowed size range of the required message type.
fn tlv_from_bytes<M: Message>(header: &Header, bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<M, TlvError> {
    ...
}

/// Serializes a TLV header and a message into a byte buffer.
fn tlv_into_bytes<M: Message>(message: M) -> Vec<u8> {
    ...
}
```

## Messages

Since the various types of messages are constructed with different kind of data, there can not be a single constructor
signature in the `Message` trait. Implementations are then expected to provide a convenient `new` method to build them.

### Endianness

All multi-byte number fields of the messages of the protocol are represented as
[big-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness).

### Version 0

#### `Handshake`

Type ID: `1`

A message that allows two nodes to pair.
Contains useful information to verify that the pairing node is operating on the same configuration.
Any difference in configuration will end up in the connection being closed and the nodes not pairing.

|Name|Description|Type|Length|
|----|-----------|----|------|
|`port`|Protocol port of the node<sup>1</sup>.|`u16`|2|
|`timestamp`|Timestamp - in ms - when the message was created by the node.|`u64`|8|
|`coordinator`|Public key of the coordinator being tracked by the node.|``[u8; 49]``|49|
|`minimum_weight_magnitude`|Minimum Weight Magnitude of the node.|`u8`|1|
|`supported_versions`|Protocol versions supported by the node<sup>2</sup>.|`Vec<u8>`|1-32|

<sup>1</sup> When an incoming connection is created, a random port is attributed. This field contains the actual port
being used by the node and is used to match the connection with a potential white-listed peer.

<sup>2</sup> Bit-masks are used to denote what protocol versions the node supports. The LSB acts as a starting point.
Up to 32 bytes are supported, limiting the number of protocol versions to 256. Examples:
* `[0b00000001]` denotes that the node supports protocol version 1.
* `[0b00000111]` denotes that the node supports protocol versions 1, 2 and 3.
* `[0b01101110]` denotes that the node supports protocol versions 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7.
*  `[0b01101110, 0b01010001]` denotes that the node supports protocol versions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13 and 15.
* `[0b01101110, 0b01010001, 0b00010001]` denotes that the node supports protocol versions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 15, 17
  and 21.

### Version 1

#### `LegacyGossip`

Type ID: `2`

A legacy message to send a transaction and request another one at the same time.

|Name|Description|Type|Length|
|----|-----------|----|------|
|`transaction`|Transaction to send. Can be compressed<sup>1</sup>.|`Vec<u8>`|292-1604|
|`hash`|Hash of the requested transaction.|`[u8; 49]`|49|

<sup>1</sup> Compression is detailed at the end.

**Note**: This message is the original IRI protocol message before the TLV protocol was introduced. It was kept by
HORNET for compatibility with IRI but is not used between HORNET nodes. Its "ping-pong" concept has complex consequences
on the node design and as such will not be implemented by Bee.

### Version 2

#### `MilestoneRequest`

Type ID: `3`

A message to request a milestone.

|Name|Description|Type|Length|
|----|-----------|----|------|
|`index`|Index of the requested milestone.|`u32`|4|

#### `Transaction`

Type ID: `4`

A message to send a transaction.

|Name|Description|Type|Length|
|----|-----------|----|------|
|`transaction`|Transaction to send. Can be compressed<sup>1</sup>.|`Vec<u8>`|292-1604|

<sup>1</sup> Compression is detailed at the end.

#### `TransactionRequest`

Type ID: `5`

A message to request a transaction.

|Name|Description|Type|Length|
|----|-----------|----|------|
|`hash`|Hash of the requested transaction.|`[u8; 49]`|49|

#### `Heartbeat`

Type ID: `6`

A message that informs about the part of the Tangle currently being fully stored by a node.
This message is sent when a node:
* just got paired to another node;
* did a local snapshot and pruned away a part of the Tangle;
* solidified a new milestone;

It also helps other nodes to know if they can ask it a specific transaction.

|Name|Description|Type|Length|
|----|-----------|----|------|
|`solid_milestone_index`|Index of the last solid milestone.|`u32`|4|
|`snapshot_milestone_index`|Index of the snapshotted milestone.|`u32`|4|

### Compression

A transaction encoded in bytes - using the T5B1 codec - has a length of `1604`. The `payload` field itself occupies
`1312` bytes and is often partially or completely filled with `0`s. For this reason, trailing `0`s of the `payload`
field are removed, providing a compression rate up to nearly 82%. Only the `payload` field is altered during this
compression and the order of the fields stays the same.

Proposed functions:
```rust
fn compress_transaction_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> Vec<u8> {
    ...
}

fn uncompress_transaction_bytes(bytes: &[u8]) -> [u8; 1604] {
    ...
}
```

# Drawbacks

Since IRI nodes only implement version `0` and `1` and Bee nodes only implement versions `0` and `2`, they will not be
able to communicate with each other.

# Rationale and alternatives

There are alternatives to a type-length-value protocol but it is very efficient and easily updatable without breaking
change. Also, since this is the protocol that has been chosen for the IOTA network, there is no other alternative for
Bee.

# Unresolved questions

There are no open questions at this point.
This protocol has been used for a long time and this RFC will be updated with new message types when/if needed.
