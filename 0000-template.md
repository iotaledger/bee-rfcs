# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Detailed design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the IOTA and to understand, and for somebody familiar with Rust
to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases, and include
examples of how the feature is used.

# Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?
